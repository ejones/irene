2012-07-28
----------
- JavaScript code is now wrapped in closures on output.
- in HTML files, instead of compiling each CSS and JavaScript resource
  separately and injecting it where the link or script tag was in the page, all
  such dependencies are combined into a single compiled unit, and inline scripts
  or styles are included now as well. The CSS generated in this way is injected
  at the end of the head; JavaScript is injected at the end of the body.
